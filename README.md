A DALI Lab website

Hi! Unfortunately, although my site deployed locally, I have been unable to deploy it both through Vercel and Netlify, and I am still troubleshooting this issue. To deploy this site locally on another computer, you can install the Gridsome CLI tool using npm in terminal npm install --global @gridsome/cli or yarn yarn global add @gridsome/cli. From there, you can open the project in terminal and run "gridsome develop" in terminal to deploy it locally. I sincerely apologize for this: I know it is extremely inconvenient and cumbersome. If this is too much of a hassle, I have attached screenshots of my website in this repository.

Once again, I apologize for the lack of deployment.
